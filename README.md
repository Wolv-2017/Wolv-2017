The Python To-Do List Application is a simple yet effective task management tool designed for users who want to keep track of their daily tasks efficiently. Built using Python's Tkinter library for the graphical user interface and JSON for data storage, this application provides an intuitive and user-friendly experience for managing tasks.

Key Features:

User-Friendly Interface: The application features a clean and simple GUI created with Tkinter, making it easy for users of all ages to navigate and use the tool.

Task Management: Users can add, edit, and delete tasks, allowing for dynamic and flexible task management. Each task can include a description and an optional due date.

Persistent Storage: Tasks are stored in a JSON file, ensuring that data is preserved between sessions. This means users can close and reopen the application without losing their saved tasks.

Task Completion: Users can mark tasks as complete, allowing for an organized view of ongoing and finished tasks. Completed tasks can be filtered or hidden from the main view.

Sort and Filter Options: The application allows users to sort tasks by priority or due date, making it easier to focus on urgent tasks.

Responsive Design: The layout is designed to be responsive, adapting to different screen sizes while maintaining usability.

Technologies Used:

Python: The core programming language for developing the application.
Tkinter: The standard GUI toolkit for Python, used to create the graphical user interface.
JSON: A lightweight data interchange format used for storing task data in a structured format.
Usage:

To run the application, simply execute the main Python script. The GUI will open, allowing users to start managing their tasks immediately.
Users can add tasks by entering the task description in the input field and clicking the “Add Task” button.
To edit or delete a task, users can select a task from the list and choose the appropriate action.
The application automatically saves all changes to the tasks in a JSON file located in the same directory as the script.
